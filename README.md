# Master Project 2019

### Introduction

This is my master project on automated geographical alignment procedure through dense point cloud simplification. Current state of the art algorithms do perform well when aligning relatively simple point clouds. However when the number of points and the complexity of clouds increases, existing algorithms tend to get stuck in local minimas and never find the optimal solution. This is due to the fact that the number of points and topological complexity of the
