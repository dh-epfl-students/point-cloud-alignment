Papers:
	-	Efficient Global Point Cloud Alignment Using Bayesian Nonparametric Mixtures.
		1.	Align two similar point clouds -> The sample of "harder" point cloud used to test the algo has an average overlap of 84%, LIDAR scans.

	-	Automated markerless registration of point clouds from TLS and structured light scanner for heritage documentation.
		https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1296207418302930?dgcid=author

	-	Full automatic registration of laser scanner point clouds
		https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246261880_Full_automatic_registration_of_laser_scanner_point_clouds

		It uses markers on the objects to transform each local point cloud into the ground coordinates.

	-	AUTOMATIC REGISTRATION OF TERRESTRIAL LASER SCANNER POINT CLOUDS USING NATURAL PLANAR SURFACES
	https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266581225_Automatic_registration_of_terrestrial_laser_scanner_point_clouds_using_natural_planar_surfaces

	First find tie points and match them between planes to obtain a coarse registration, then use a fine registration process like ICP.

	-	Point cloud alignment: ICP methods compared
	https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/865830/Point-cloud-alignment-ICP-methods-compared
		-	4 Implementations of ICP compared, with mathematical background.
